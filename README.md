# PowerBI-Project

This is a small project showing the sales of Madhav E-Commerce.
The workflow goes like:
Loading the CSV file to powerBI Desktop.
Modelling the data.
Deleting multiple columns and setting data types.
Building different charts for data visual.
At last, i have made a dash-board showing:
sum of profit by month
sum of quantity by category per month
sum of quantity by paymentMode per month
sum of amount by month
sum of amount by customerName.
